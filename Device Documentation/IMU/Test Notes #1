BNO055 Label With VIN On Left [Reference Frame]
Linear Acceleration:
    Positive Y Axis Oriented North of BN0555 Label
    Positive X Axis Oriented East Of BN0555 Label
    Positive Z Axis Oriented Above Face Of Chip
Gyro (Angular Velocity Orientation):
    # Relative to Axis in which rotated towards.

    # For example applying torque which rotates around the Y-Axis does not 
    # produce angular velocity in the Y vector.

    # It produces angular velocity in the X axis.

    Alternative Orientation Map:
        X-Axis : Axis Oriented North of BN0555 Label (Rotating around)
        Y-Axis : Axis Oriented East Of BN0555 Label (Rotating around)
        Z-Axis : Axis Oriented Above Face Of Chip (Rotating around)
