NMEA Sentence Conveter

Operational Frequency L1 Frequency, and communicates with GPS satellites.
	1575.42MHz
Antenna 15mm x 15mm x 4mm
Update frequency, 10Hz

Complexities:
	3D-FIX: Set if the gps has atleast three satellite gps connections
	DPLUS and DOMIUS: ignore these they are only useful for USB connections
	ENABLE: Acts as the control switch.
Power Type:
	3.3v

Communication Standards:
	The device is faulty if the parity bit is 1 and there are an even about of bits.
	

Usage:
if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    char receivedChar = Serial.read();
    // Process the received character or data here
}

bool checkParity(char data) {
  int numOnes = 0;

  // Count the number of ones in the binary representation of the character
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
    if (data & (1 << i)) {
      numOnes++;
    }
  }

  // If the number of ones is even, return false (no error)
  // If the number of ones is odd, return true (parity error)
  return (numOnes % 2 != 0);
}
