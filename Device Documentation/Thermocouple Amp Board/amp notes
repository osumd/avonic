    -210°C to +1800°C

Power Supply:
    3.3v to 5V

Pins:
    VIN: (3.3v - 5v) Input

    GND: Ground
    SCK: Clock
    SDO: Serial Output
    SDI: Serial In
    CS:  Control Switch, Drop Low to start SPI transactions.
    FLT: If you use the threshhold-notification capabilities of
         the MAX31856 you can monitor this pin, when it goes low there's a fault!
    DRDY: 
         This pin is used for advanced uses where you tell the sensor to begin a
        reading and then wait for this pin to go low. We don't use it in our library code
        because we keep it simple with a delay/wait, but it is available in case you need
        it

Library:
    Adafruit_MAX31856 Library
